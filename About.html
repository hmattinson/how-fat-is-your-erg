  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Formula taken from <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.concept2.co.uk/indoor-rowers/training/calculators/weight-adjustment-calculator">Concept website:</a></p></p>
  <p>Power = 2.8/(pace*pace*pace)</p>
  <p>where pace is time in seconds over distance in metres.</p>
  <p>Weight Factor = (Weight in pounds / 270) to the power of 0.222</p>
  <p>Corected Time = Weight Factor * Time</p>
  <p>Corrected Distance = Distance / Weight Factor</p>
  <br>
  <p>From their <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.concept2.co.uk/indoor-rowers/training/calculators/weight-adjustment-calculator">website:</a></p>
  <p>"Your weight-adjusted score will be a pretty good estimate of your potential speed in an eight. If all eight rowers have the same
    adjusted 2k score, then that eight should be capable of rowing that speed for a 2k race on the waterâ€”given perfect conditions
    and near perfect rowing effectiveness (nobody rows perfectly)."</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Classifying FATNESS</p>
  <p>I wanted a way to take into account weight,power and distance to create one metric that I could then test against a baseline metric. The problem
    initially was that over shorter distance any rower will put out more power. To take this into account I made the metric:</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#945 = (Power/Weight Factor)*Distance^&#946</p>
  <p>Where &#946 is 0.217. This was worked out by finding the value that would minimise the deviation &#945 for a variety of mens' records.
    Deviation was still moderately high but when ording events by &#945 the order of the distance/time of the events seemed suitably random.</p>
  <p>Next I simply set a threshold value for &#945</p>
